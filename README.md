# Books explorer

## About
This project was made for a coding challenge given by [Makers](https://makers.build).

## About the project
I choose to use the the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) to query books based on title. I decided to use Python3 Django framework both on frontend and backend of the application, because I want to learn more about it.

# Running
To run you need to have python3 and pip installed. After installing the required packages (requirements.txt), you can simply use the command `python3 manage.py runserver`.

# Public URL
The project was deployed on AWS EC2 and is public available on the URL http://3.145.41.34:8000/books/
